      located 2km from Shettihalli, Hassan, in Karnataka. Built in the 1860s by
      the French missionaries in India, the church is a magnificent structure of
      Gothic Architecture.After the construction of the Hemavati Dam and
      Reservoir in 1960 the church was Submerged under water due to the dam
      It has since then become a famous tourist spot where people flock to see
      the half submerged church during monsoon. It is also known as The
      Submerged Church and The Floating Church To enjoy the surreal beauty of
      Shettihalli church,one needs to travel to this place twice. Once in
      the month of July–October when it is partially submerged in water and next
      in the month of Dec–May when the water level recedes and the church
      grounds emerge.By road, the distance between Shettihalli and Bangalore
      is 200 km and can be easily accessed through roads. Buses are available as
      well which drop to Shettihalli Church.Trains frequent on a daily basis
      from Yashwantpur railway station to Hassan, Karnataka, which is the
      nearest town, approximately 40 km from Shettihalli.
